> **TL;DR** — This paper introduces knowledge redundancy as a construct for predicting open-source project survival after founder departure. Due to data limitations (lack of file paths for Jaccard similarity, N=6 repositories with departure, 100% survival rate), we could not empirically test the inverted-U hypothesis. Instead, we provide a methodological framework, validate it on synthetic data, and offer open-source tools for future validation with adequate data.

<details>
<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

The relationship between knowledge redundancy (overlap in contributor expertise measured via Jaccard similarity of file sets) and open-source project survival after founder departure is predicted to be inverted-U shaped: projects with moderate knowledge redundancy survive at higher rates than both those with zero redundancy (all critical knowledge held by founder) and those with excessive redundancy (all contributors know the same things, with no specialization). This prediction is grounded in information theory (error-correcting codes), organizational psychology (transactive memory systems), and ecology (diversity-stability hypothesis). However, this hypothesis remains UNTESTED because: (1) proper measurement requires commit-level file path data for Jaccard similarity computation, which was unavailable in the current pre-processed dataset; (2) the fallback pseudo-KR measure (cosine similarity of file count distributions) is acknowledged as an invalid proxy; and (3) the sample of 6 repositories with founder departure had 100% survival rate, providing no outcome variance for survival modeling. The contribution of this study is the conceptual framework, measurement methodology, and identification of data requirements (N≥50 repositories with file paths) for future large-scale validation.
