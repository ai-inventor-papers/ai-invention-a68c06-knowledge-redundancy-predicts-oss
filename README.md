> **TL;DR** — This methodological validation study introduces knowledge redundancy (measured via Jaccard similarity of file modifications) as a candidate predictor of open-source project survival after founder departure. Testing the inverted-U hypothesis on 1,000 synthetic GitHub repositories using Cox proportional hazards models, the study finds no evidence for the hypothesized relationship: the quadratic term is not significant (p = 0.71), and survival rate differences are small (1-3%). The paper provides open-source tools for computing knowledge redundancy, honestly reports null results, and outlines future steps for real-data validation.

<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

The relationship between knowledge redundancy (overlap in contributor expertise measured via Jaccard similarity of file modifications) and open-source project survival after founder departure can be measured and tested using Cox proportional hazards models, but the hypothesized inverted-U shaped relationship is not supported by synthetic data validation (quadratic term p=0.71). Knowledge redundancy is computable at scale from git histories and provides a distinct metric from bus factor (r=-0.34, p<0.001), but its relationship to survival requires validation on real GitHub data. The null result on synthetic data suggests either: (1) the inverted-U relationship does not exist in OSS contexts, (2) the effect size is smaller than hypothesized (<5% difference in survival rates), or (3) the measurement approach requires refinement to capture true expertise overlap beyond file modification patterns.
