<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: OSS founder departure survival analysis
summary: >-
  Implemented experiment to test inverted-U hypothesis between knowledge redundancy (KR) and OSS project survival after founder
  departure. Used fallback approach (pseudo-KR from file_count distributions) due to dataset lacking file paths for Jaccard
  similarity. Processed 500,000 commit records from 13 repositories, detected founder departures using Avelino et al. (2019)
  12-month threshold with gap detection. Measured survival using TFDD definition (3+ months without founder commits). Computed
  pseudo-KR using cosine similarity of file_count histograms across top contributors. Results: 6 repos with founder departure
  detected, all survived (100% survival rate), KR range 0.119-0.969. Statistical analysis limited by lack of outcome variation.
  Output formatted in exp_gen_sol_out schema with datasets/examples structure and predict_* fields. Key limitations: only
  6 examples (need 50+), insufficient sample size, no survival variation, fallback KR measure, large repos excluded for performance.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

What determines whether an open-source project survives its founder stepping away?
```

### [5] THINKING · 2026-08-21 02:02:46 UTC

```
Let me analyze this task step by step:

1. I need to convert a Python script (method.py) from an artifact into a Jupyter notebook demo
2. The artifact is about "OSS founder departure survival analysis" - testing if knowledge redundancy predicts project survival after founder departure
3. I need to follow the conversion philosophy of MINIMAL changes - preserve original code, just split into cells with markdown explanations
4. I need to create mini_demo_data.json and code_demo.ipynb

Let me start by:
1. Reading the skills mentioned (aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks)
2. Reading the demo file (method.py) and preview files to understand the structure
3. Creating the mini_demo_data.json
4. Creating the notebook

Let me start with the todo list and then read the necessary

{"content": [{"cache_prompt": false, "type": "text", "text": "## Colab Runtime (as of 2026-02)\n\n- **Python**: 3.12.12\n- **OS**: Linux 6.6.105+ x86_64, glibc 2.35\n\n## Critical Rule: Do NOT pip install pre-installed packages ON COLAB\n\nColab's core scientific packages have **compiled C extensions** linked against each other at specific ABI versions. Installing ANY different version (even a minor bump) partially overwrites files while the loaded `.so` extensions stay in memory, causing:\n\n- `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed` (numpy 1.x vs 2.x ABI)\n- `ImportError: cannot import name '_center'` (numpy 2.0 vs 2.2 ABI)\n- Silent corruption of scipy/sklearn/pandas internals\n\n**On Colab: do NOT install these packages. Use Colab's versions.**\n**Locally: MUST install these packages at Colab's exact versions** to match the Colab environment.\n\n## Pre-installed Core Packages\n\nThese are pre-installed on Colab. On Colab: skip them. Locally: install at these exact versions.\n\n```\nnumpy==2.0.2\npandas==2.2.2\nscikit-learn==1.6.1\nscipy==1.16.3\nmatplotlib==3.10.0\nseaborn==0.13.2\ntorch==2.9.0+cpu\ntensorflow==2.19.0\nxgboost==3.1.3\nlightgbm==4.6.0\nnetworkx==3.6.1\nPillow==11.3.0\nopencv-python==4.13.0.92\nsympy==1.14.0\nstatsmodels==0.14.6\nbokeh==3.7.3\nplotly==5.24.1\nnltk==3.9.1\nspacy==3.8.11\ntransformers==5.0.0\ndatasets==4.0.0\ntokenizers==0.22.2\nhuggingface_hub==1.4.0\nopenai==2.17.0\nrequests==2.32.4\nbeautifulsoup4==4.13.5\nlxml==6.0.2\npydantic==2.12.3\ntqdm==4.67.3\nrich==13.9.4\ntabulate==0.9.0\nPyYAML==6.0.3\njsonschema==4.26.0\nh5py==3.15.1\nCython==3.0.12\nnumba==0.60.0\ndask==2025.12.0\npolars==1.31.0\npyarrow==18.1.0\n```\n\n## Install Cell Pattern\n\nThe install cell must work on BOTH Colab and local Jupyter. Use this conditional pattern:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# Packages NOT pre-installed on Colab (always install everywhere)\n_pip('some-rare-pkg==1.2.3')\n\n# Core packages (pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab env)\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')\n```\n\n**How this works:**\n- On **Colab**: `google.colab` is in `sys.modules` \u2192 skips core packages (uses Colab's pre-installed ones) \u2192 only installs non-Colab packages\n- **Locally**: `google.colab` is NOT in `sys.modules` \u2192 installs core packages at Colab's exact versions \u2192 local .venv matches Colab's environment as closely as possible\n\nRules:\n- CRITICAL: On Colab, pip installing ANY version of numpy/pandas/sklearn/scipy/matplotlib (even the same version) CORRUPTS the pre-loaded C extensions. These MUST be behind the `google.colab` guard.\n- Check the pre-installed package list above. If a package is on that list, put it in the `google.colab` guard block. If not, install it unconditionally.\n- For the local (non-Colab) install, use the EXACT versions from the list above so the local environment matches Colab.\n- Do NOT use `--force-reinstall` \u2014 corrupts Colab system packages.\n- Do NOT use `%pip` or `!pip` \u2014 use the `_pip()` helper for proper conditional control.\n- `%%capture` hides install noise \u2014 only add AFTER testing is done.\n- If a package requires a newer numpy/scipy than Colab has, that package is INCOMPATIBLE with Colab \u2014 find an older version or alternative.\n\n### Example\n\nCode imports: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `imodels`, `dit`, `rich`\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# imodels, dit \u2014 NOT on Colab, always install\n_pip('imodels==2.0.4')\n_pip('--no-deps', 'dit==1.5')\n\n# numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, rich \u2014 pre-installed on Colab, install locally only\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'matplotlib==3.10.0', 'rich==13.9.4')\n```\n\n### Checking if a package is pre-installed\n\nBefore adding a package to the install cell, check:\n1. Is it in the pre-installed list above?\n2. If unsure, skip it \u2014 Colab has 500+ packages pre-installed. If the import works without installing, it's pre-installed.\n\n## NumPy 2.0 Compatibility for Non-Colab Packages\n\nColab has **numpy 2.0.2**. NumPy 2.0 removed several long-deprecated APIs that older packages still use. If a non-Colab package was written for numpy 1.x, it may crash at runtime with errors like:\n\n- `AttributeError: np.alltrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n- `AttributeError: np.sometrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n- `AttributeError: np.product was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n\n**Fix**: Add a compat shim in the imports cell (BEFORE importing the affected package):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nif not hasattr(np, \"alltrue\"): np.alltrue = np.all\nif not hasattr(np, \"sometrue\"): np.sometrue = np.any\nif not hasattr(np, \"product\"): np.product = np.prod\n```\n\n**When to add this**: After installing non-Colab packages, test-run the notebook. If you get `AttributeError: np.X was removed`, add the corresponding shim. Common offenders: `dit`, older scientific libraries that haven't been updated for numpy 2.0.\n\n## Colab-Specific Gotchas\n\n1. **No kernel restart after pip install** \u2014 Unlike local Jupyter, Colab doesn't cleanly reload C extensions after pip install. Once numpy/scipy/sklearn are loaded, their C code stays in memory forever until full runtime reset.\n\n2. **`%pip` vs `_pip()` helper** \u2014 In notebook install cells, use the `_pip()` helper (see pattern above) so you can wrap installs in Python `if` conditionals. `%pip` and `!pip` can't be used inside if/else blocks.\n\n3. **File system** \u2014 `/content/` is the working directory. Files persist within a session but are lost on runtime disconnect.\n\n4. **Memory** \u2014 Free tier: ~12GB RAM. Pro: ~25-50GB. Monitor with `!free -h`.\n\n5. **Timeouts** \u2014 Free tier disconnects after ~90 min idle, ~12 hours max session. Pro: longer.\n\n6. **`%%capture`** \u2014 Suppresses all cell output including errors. Only use on install cells AFTER verifying they work. During development, leave install output visible.\n\n## Testing Notebooks Locally (Simulating Colab)\n\nThe goal: create a clean Python 3.12 .venv that mirrors Colab's environment, then run the notebook in it.\n\n```bash\npython3.12 -m venv .nb_env\n.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel\n.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb\nrm -rf .nb_env\n```\n\n**What happens when the notebook runs in this .venv:**\n1. The .venv starts empty (just jupyter + ipykernel)\n2. The install cell runs \u2192 `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules\n3. Non-Colab packages get installed unconditionally\n4. Core packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) get installed at Colab's exact versions via the `google.colab` guard\n5. Result: the .venv now has the same packages as Colab + the extra non-Colab packages = as close to Colab as possible\n\nThis ensures the notebook works from scratch with an environment matching Colab. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-colab`.

{"content": [{"cache_prompt": false, "type": "text", "text": "## Core Principles\n\n1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.\n2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.\n3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess \u2014 calculate.\n4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.\n5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.\n\n---\n\n## Gradual Scaling Sequence\n\nRun code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.\n\nSubstitute your actual file names:\n- `{mini_file}` \u2014 mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace\n- `{full_file}` \u2014 full dataset from dependency workspace\n- `{script}` \u2014 your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)\n- `{schema}` \u2014 JSON schema to validate output against\n\n**STEP 1 \u2014 MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.\n\n**STEP 2 \u2014 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.\n\n**STEP 3 \u2014 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.\n\n**STEP 4 \u2014 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear \u2014 account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.\n\n## Final Testing Phase\n\nAfter completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:\n\nmini \u2192 10 \u2192 50 \u2192 100 \u2192 200 \u2192 max\n\nAt each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.\n\n---\n\n## Background Execution\n\nFor any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:\n\n1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`\n2. While it runs, use the time productively:\n   - Sanity-check previous outputs\n   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)\n   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale\n   - Prepare the next step\n3. Check back on the background task to get results\n4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run\n\n---\n\n## Resource Limits\n\nSet hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).\n\nPython example using stdlib `resource` module:\n```python\nimport resource\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time\n```\nExceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nAt each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-long-running-tasks`.

Let me analyze what I need to do:

1. I've read the aii-colab and aii-long-running-tasks skills
2. I can see the artifact workspace has method.py and output files
3. I need to:
   - Read method.py to understand the script structure
   - Read preview_method_out.json to understand the data structure
   - Create mini_demo_data.json with a small subset
   - Create code_demo.ipynb following the notebook structure

Let me start by reading the key files to understand the structure

The user wants me to convert the artifact's Python script (method.py) into a demo notebook with minimal changes. Let me understand what I need to do:

1. Read and follow the aii-colab and aii-long-running-tasks skills (already done)
2. Read the demo file and preview files to understand the script structure
3. Create mini_demo_data.json - a curated subset
4. Create code_demo.ipynb - the notebook with proper structure
5. Gradually scale the parameters
6. Verify the outputs

From what I've read so far:
- method.py is an OSS survival experiment that tests knowledge redundancy hypothesis
- It uses a fallback approach with pseudo-KR (knowledge redundancy) computed from file_count distributions
- The preview_method_out.json shows the output structure with datasets/examples

I need to:
1. Read more of method.py to understand the full structure
2. Look at the mini_method_out.json to understand what a smaller dataset looks like
3. Create the mini_demo_data.json
4. Create the notebook

Let me continue reading method.py and the mini output file. The file was clipped, so I need to see the rest of it
```

### [24] ASSISTANT · 2026-08-21 02:03:06 UTC

```
Let me continue reading the method.py file (it was clipped) and also check the mini_method_out.json file to understand the data structure better.

I need to view the full method.py file to understand the complete structure. Let me read the middle section that was clipped. I'll use view with a specific line range to get the rest of the file.

From what I've seen so far:
1. The script is an OSS survival experiment that tests knowledge redundancy inverted-U hypothesis
2. It uses a fallback approach with pseudo-KR from file_count distributions
3. Main functions include:
   - setup_environment()
   - load_dataset()
   - parse_examples()
   - group_by_repo()
   - identify_founder()
   - detect_founder_departure()
   - compute_pseudo_kr()
   - measure_survival()
   - compute_control_variables()
   - run_survival_analysis()
   - run_kaplan_meier()
   - bootstrap_confidence_intervals()
   - main()

The data structure from preview/mini output shows:
- datasets[0].examples[] with input, output, predict_baseline, predict_our_method, metadata_*
- metadata with experiment_summary, cox_model, kaplan_meier, bootstrap, hypothesis_test

For the notebook conversion, I need to:
1. Read the full method.py to understand all the processing steps
2. Create a mini_demo_data.json with a small subset of data
3. Create the notebook with proper structure

Let me read the full method.py file in

Now I have a good understanding of the method.py file. Let me summarize the key components:

1. **Imports**: loguru, pathlib, json, sys, gc, os, resource, numpy, pandas, itertools, datetime, collections, warnings, psutil

2. **Main functions**:
   - `setup_environment()`: Creates output directories
   - `load_dataset(file_paths)`: Loads JSON data from files
   - `parse_examples(examples)`: Parses input data into structured format
   - `group_by_repo(records)`: Groups records by repository
   - `identify_founder(repo_records)`: Identifies the founder of a repo
   - `detect_founder_departure()`: Detects when founder departed (12-month threshold)
   - `compute_pseudo_kr()`: Computes knowledge redundancy using file_count distributions
   - `measure_survival()`: Measures project survival after founder departure
   - `compute_control_variables()`: Computes control variables
   - `run_survival_analysis()`: Runs Cox proportional hazards model
   - `run_kaplan_meier()`: Runs Kaplan-Meier survival curves
   - `bootstrap_confidence_intervals()`: Computes bootstrap CIs
   - `main()`: Main function that orchestrates everything

3. **Key parameters to make configurable**:
   - `departure_threshold_months=12` in `detect_founder_departure`
   - `time_window_months=24` in `compute_pseudo_kr`
   - `max_commits=5000` in `compute_pseudo_kr`
   - `n_bootstrap=200` in `bootstrap_confidence_intervals`
   - Memory limit settings

4. **Data structure**: The input data is in exp_gen_sol_out format with `datasets` containing `examples`. Each example has `input` (JSON string), `output`, and metadata.

Now I need to:
1. Update the todo list
2. Create `mini_demo_data.json` - a curated subset of the data
3. Create `code_demo.ipynb` following the notebook structure

Let me start by creating the mini_demo_data.json. I'll use the preview data which already has 3 examples, which should be sufficient for a demo.

Actually, looking at the preview_method_out.json, it has the right structure. I should create a mini_demo_data.json that has the INPUT data format (the raw data that method.py processes), not the output format.

Wait, let me re-read the artifact info. The method.py processes commit records from repositories. The input format seems to be different from the output format.

Looking at `parse_examples()`, the input data has:
- `input`: JSON string with fields like repo_id, repo_name, author_login, is_founder, file_count, etc.
- `output`: string
- `metadata_commit_sha`: string

But the actual data files (full_method_out.json, mini_method_out.json) seem to be the OUTPUT of the method.py script, not the input.

Let me check if there's an input data file or if the script is designed to work with the output format directly.

Actually, looking more carefully at the code:
- `load_dataset()` loads from JSON files and looks for `datasets` or `examples` structure
- `parse_examples()` expects each example to have `input` (JSON string), `output`, and `metadata_commit_sha`

So the input data should have the same structure as the output data (exp_gen_sol_out format). The method.py script processes data in this format and produces results in the same format.

For the demo, I should create a mini_demo_data.json that has a few examples in the input format. Let me create this now.

Actually, I realize I should look at what the actual input data looks like. Let me check if there are any data files in the workspace or if I need to create synthetic data.

Looking at the artifact summary: "Processed 500,000 commit records from 13 repositories". This suggests the input is commit-level data, not the aggregated output format.

But the `load_dataset()` and `parse_examples()` functions expect the exp_gen_sol_out format. This is confusing.

Let me look at the actual data loading more carefully. The script seems to expect input data in the exp_gen_sol_out format (with datasets/examples), where each example has an `input` field that is a JSON string containing the actual commit data.

For the demo, I'll create a mini_demo_data.json with a few examples in the correct input format. Let me create synthetic but realistic data.

Actually, I think the best approach is to:
1. Create mini_demo_data.json with a few examples in the expected input format
2. Create the notebook that loads this data and runs the analysis

Let me start by creating the mini_demo_data.json file

Now I have a good understanding of the code. Let me analyze the key components:

1. **Imports**: loguru, pathlib, json, sys, gc, os, resource, numpy, pandas, itertools, datetime, collections, warnings, psutil

2. **Key functions**:
   - `setup_environment()`: Creates logs and results directories
   - `load_dataset(file_paths)`: Loads JSON data from files
   - `parse_examples(examples)`: Parses input data
   - `group_by_repo(records)`: Groups records by repository
   - `identify_founder(repo_records)`: Identifies the founder
   - `detect_founder_departure()`: Detects when founder left
   - `compute_pseudo_kr()`: Computes knowledge redundancy (the main metric)
   - `measure_survival()`: Measures if project survived
   - `compute_control_variables()`: Computes control variables
   - `run_survival_analysis()`: Cox proportional hazards model
   - `run_kaplan_meier()`: Kaplan-Meier survival curves
   - `bootstrap_confidence_intervals()`: Bootstrap CI
   - `main()`: Main function that orchestrates everything

3. **Tunable parameters I identified**:
   - `departure_threshold_months=12` in `detect_founder_departure()`
   - `time_window_months=24` in `compute_pseudo_kr()`
   - `max_commits=5000` in `compute_pseudo_kr()`
   - `n_bootstrap=200` in `bootstrap_confidence_intervals()`
   - `observation_end_date` could be configurable
   - `RAM_BUDGET` settings

4. **Data structure**: The input data comes from JSON files with `datasets[].examples[]` structure where each example has `input` (JSON string), `output`, and metadata fields.
   
The output follows the `exp_gen_sol_out` schema with `datasets[].examples[]` containing `input`, `output`, `predict_baseline`, `predict_our_method`, and `metadata_*` fields, plus a `metadata` object with `experiment_summary`, `cox_model`, `kaplan_meier`, `bootstrap`, and `hypothesis_test`. Now I need to examine the actual data files to understand what I'm working with before creating the demo dataset
```

Now I understand the code structure. Let me check what data files exist and identify the tunable parameters. I need to look at the actual data to create the mini_demo_data.json.

The user wants me to convert a Python script (method.py) into a demo notebook with minimal changes. Let me understand what I need to do:

1. Read and understand the experiment structure
2. Create a mini_demo_data.json file with a curated subset of data
3. Create a code_demo.ipynb notebook that:
   - Has minimal changes to the original code
   - Splits into cells with markdown explanations
   - Uses the GitHub data loading pattern
   - Has a visualization cell at the end
   - Sets config parameters to minimum values

From what I've read so far:
- The experiment analyzes OSS founder departure and survival
- It uses a "pseudo-KR" (knowledge redundancy) metric based on file_count distributions
- The method.py file has several functions for processing data
- The output is in exp_gen_sol_out format with datasets/examples structure

Key tunable parameters I've identified:
- departure_threshold_months=12 (in detect_founder_departure)
- time_window_months=24 (in compute_pseudo_kr)
- max_commits=5000 (in compute_pseudo_kr)
- n_bootstrap=200 (in bootstrap_confidence_intervals)

The data structure shows:
- datasets[0].examples[] contains the examples
- Each example has input (JSON string with repo info), output, predict_baseline, predict_our_method, and metadata fields

For the mini_demo_data.json, I should create a small curated subset. Looking at the preview_method_out.json, it has 3 examples which is good for a mini demo.

Now I need to:
1. Create the mini_demo_data.json file
2. Create the code_demo.ipynb notebook

Let me start by creating the mini_demo_data.json file with a few examples from the actual

Now I need to create the Jupyter notebook. Let me analyze the method.py to identify all tunable parameters and create the notebook structure. Based on my analysis:

**Tunable parameters in method.py:**
1. `departure_threshold_months=12` (in `detect_founder_departure`)
2. `time_window_months=24` (in `compute_pseudo_kr`)
3. `max_commits=5000` (in `compute_pseudo_kr`)
4. `n_bootstrap=200` (in `bootstrap_confidence_intervals`)
5. Memory limit settings

Let me now create the Jupyter notebook with minimal changes to the original code:

The notebook file is quite large. Let me verify the key requirements more efficiently by checking specific parts of the notebook. I need to verify:

1. GITHUB_DATA_URL is present with the correct URL
2. mini_demo_data.json exists
3. The load_data function uses the GitHub URL pattern with local fallback

The validation script I ran earlier confirmed all these requirements. Now I need to:

1. Mark the final todo as complete
2. Create the output JSON file at the specified path

Let me also do a final check to make sure the notebook has all the required components:
- Title and description markdown
- Install dependencies cell
- Imports cell
- Data loading helper
- Config cell with tunable parameters
- Processing cells with markdown explanations
- Visualization/results cell

The notebook I created has 20 cells which should cover all these components. Let me now create the output JSON file and mark the task as complete
