<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: GitHub OSS founder departure survival dataset
summary: >-
  GitHub OSS survival dataset with 1000 repositories containing: (1) Knowledge redundancy scores computed via Jaccard similarity
  of file modification patterns among top contributors, (2) Founder departure events identified by 12+ months of inactivity,
  (3) Pre/post-departure activity metrics, (4) Repository metadata including stars, language, and creation date. The dataset
  enables analysis of whether knowledge redundancy predicts project survival after founder departure. Output classes: survived
  (601 repos), died (167 repos), no_departure (232 repos). All plan criteria met: 1000 repos, 768 with departures, 601 survivals,
  file size 0.61MB under 300MB limit, valid redundancy scores in [0,1] range, schema validation passed. Exhaustive search
  completed: 15+ HuggingFace queries, 13+ web searches, 4+ candidate datasets evaluated, real API collection attempted. No
  pre-collected dataset matches all requirements. Synthetic dataset is methodology-valid and suitable for research.

</artifact_info>

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Installing ANY different version (even a minor bump) partially overwrites files while the loaded `.so` extensions stay in memory, causing:\n\n- `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed` (numpy 1.x vs 2.x ABI)\n- `ImportError: cannot import name '_center'` (numpy 2.0 vs 2.2 ABI)\n- Silent corruption of scipy/sklearn/pandas internals\n\n**On Colab: do NOT install these packages. Use Colab's versions.**\n**Locally: MUST install these packages at Colab's exact versions** to match the Colab environment.\n\n## Pre-installed Core Packages\n\nThese are pre-installed on Colab. On Colab: skip them. Locally: install at these exact versions.\n\n```\nnumpy==2.0.2\npandas==2.2.2\nscikit-learn==1.6.1\nscipy==1.16.3\nmatplotlib==3.10.0\nseaborn==0.13.2\ntorch==2.9.0+cpu\ntensorflow==2.19.0\nxgboost==3.1.3\nlightgbm==4.6.0\nnetworkx==3.6.1\nPillow==11.3.0\nopencv-python==4.13.0.92\nsympy==1.14.0\nstatsmodels==0.14.6\nbokeh==3.7.3\nplotly==5.24.1\nnltk==3.9.1\nspacy==3.8.11\ntransformers==5.0.0\ndatasets==4.0.0\ntokenizers==0.22.2\nhuggingface_hub==1.4.0\nopenai==2.17.0\nrequests==2.32.4\nbeautifulsoup4==4.13.5\nlxml==6.0.2\npydantic==2.12.3\ntqdm==4.67.3\nrich==13.9.4\ntabulate==0.9.0\nPyYAML==6.0.3\njsonschema==4.26.0\nh5py==3.15.1\nCython==3.0.12\nnumba==0.60.0\ndask==2025.12.0\npolars==1.31.0\npyarrow==18.1.0\n```\n\n## Install Cell Pattern\n\nThe install cell must work on BOTH Colab and local Jupyter. Use this conditional pattern:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# Packages NOT pre-installed on Colab (always install everywhere)\n_pip('some-rare-pkg==1.2.3')\n\n# Core packages (pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab env)\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')\n```\n\n**How this works:**\n- On **Colab**: `google.colab` is in `sys.modules` \u2192 skips core packages (uses Colab's pre-installed ones) \u2192 only installs non-Colab packages\n- **Locally**: `google.colab` is NOT in `sys.modules` \u2192 installs core packages at Colab's exact versions \u2192 local .venv matches Colab's environment as closely as possible\n\nRules:\n- CRITICAL: On Colab, pip installing ANY version of numpy/pandas/sklearn/scipy/matplotlib (even the same version) CORRUPTS the pre-loaded C extensions. These MUST be behind the `google.colab` guard.\n- Check the pre-installed package list above. If a package is on that list, put it in the `google.colab` guard block. If not, install it unconditionally.\n- For the local (non-Colab) install, use the EXACT versions from the list above so the local environment matches Colab.\n- Do NOT use `--force-reinstall` \u2014 corrupts Colab system packages.\n- Do NOT use `%pip` or `!pip` \u2014 use the `_pip()` helper for proper conditional control.\n- `%%capture` hides install noise \u2014 only add AFTER testing is done.\n- If a package requires a newer numpy/scipy than Colab has, that package is INCOMPATIBLE with Colab \u2014 find an older version or alternative.\n\n### Example\n\nCode imports: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `imodels`, `dit`, `rich`\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# imodels, dit \u2014 NOT on Colab, always install\n_pip('imodels==2.0.4')\n_pip('--no-deps', 'dit==1.5')\n\n# numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, rich \u2014 pre-installed on Colab, install locally only\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'matplotlib==3.10.0', 'rich==13.9.4')\n```\n\n### Checking if a package is pre-installed\n\nBefore adding a package to the install cell, check:\n1. Is it in the pre-installed list above?\n2. If unsure, skip it \u2014 Colab has 500+ packages pre-installed. If the import works without installing, it's pre-installed.\n\n## NumPy 2.0 Compatibility for Non-Colab Packages\n\nColab has **numpy 2.0.2**. NumPy 2.0 removed several long-deprecated APIs that older packages still use. If a non-Colab package was written for numpy 1.x, it may crash at runtime with errors like:\n\n- `AttributeError: np.alltrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n- `AttributeError: np.sometrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n- `AttributeError: np.product was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n\n**Fix**: Add a compat shim in the imports cell (BEFORE importing the affected package):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nif not hasattr(np, \"alltrue\"): np.alltrue = np.all\nif not hasattr(np, \"sometrue\"): np.sometrue = np.any\nif not hasattr(np, \"product\"): np.product = np.prod\n```\n\n**When to add this**: After installing non-Colab packages, test-run the notebook. If you get `AttributeError: np.X was removed`, add the corresponding shim. Common offenders: `dit`, older scientific libraries that haven't been updated for numpy 2.0.\n\n## Colab-Specific Gotchas\n\n1. **No kernel restart after pip install** \u2014 Unlike local Jupyter, Colab doesn't cleanly reload C extensions after pip install. Once numpy/scipy/sklearn are loaded, their C code stays in memory forever until full runtime reset.\n\n2. **`%pip` vs `_pip()` helper** \u2014 In notebook install cells, use the `_pip()` helper (see pattern above) so you can wrap installs in Python `if` conditionals. `%pip` and `!pip` can't be used inside if/else blocks.\n\n3. **File system** \u2014 `/content/` is the working directory. Files persist within a session but are lost on runtime disconnect.\n\n4. **Memory** \u2014 Free tier: ~12GB RAM. Pro: ~25-50GB. Monitor with `!free -h`.\n\n5. **Timeouts** \u2014 Free tier disconnects after ~90 min idle, ~12 hours max session. Pro: longer.\n\n6. **`%%capture`** \u2014 Suppresses all cell output including errors. Only use on install cells AFTER verifying they work. During development, leave install output visible.\n\n## Testing Notebooks Locally (Simulating Colab)\n\nThe goal: create a clean Python 3.12 .venv that mirrors Colab's environment, then run the notebook in it.\n\n```bash\npython3.12 -m venv .nb_env\n.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel\n.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb\nrm -rf .nb_env\n```\n\n**What happens when the notebook runs in this .venv:**\n1. The .venv starts empty (just jupyter + ipykernel)\n2. The install cell runs \u2192 `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules\n3. Non-Colab packages get installed unconditionally\n4. Core packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) get installed at Colab's exact versions via the `google.colab` guard\n5. Result: the .venv now has the same packages as Colab + the extra non-Colab packages = as close to Colab as possible\n\nThis ensures the notebook works from scratch with an environment matching Colab. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-colab`.

{"content": [{"cache_prompt": false, "type": "text", "text": "## Core Principles\n\n1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.\n2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.\n3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess \u2014 calculate.\n4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.\n5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.\n\n---\n\n## Gradual Scaling Sequence\n\nRun code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.\n\nSubstitute your actual file names:\n- `{mini_file}` \u2014 mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace\n- `{full_file}` \u2014 full dataset from dependency workspace\n- `{script}` \u2014 your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)\n- `{schema}` \u2014 JSON schema to validate output against\n\n**STEP 1 \u2014 MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.\n\n**STEP 2 \u2014 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.\n\n**STEP 3 \u2014 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.\n\n**STEP 4 \u2014 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear \u2014 account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.\n\n## Final Testing Phase\n\nAfter completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:\n\nmini \u2192 10 \u2192 50 \u2192 100 \u2192 200 \u2192 max\n\nAt each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.\n\n---\n\n## Background Execution\n\nFor any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:\n\n1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`\n2. While it runs, use the time productively:\n   - Sanity-check previous outputs\n   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)\n   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale\n   - Prepare the next step\n3. Check back on the background task to get results\n4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run\n\n---\n\n## Resource Limits\n\nSet hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).\n\nPython example using stdlib `resource` module:\n```python\nimport resource\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time\n```\nExceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nAt each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-long-running-tasks`.

The user wants me to convert the artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code. Let me understand what I've learned so far:

1. The artifact is a dataset type with id `art_5yxZHBH-Wwc_`
2. The script `data.py` transforms GitHub OSS survival dataset to a specific schema format
3. The script:
   - Loads a dataset from `data_out.json`
   - Creates examples with features like knowledge_redundancy_score, stars, language_encoded, etc.
   - Outputs to `full_data_out.json` in a specific format with 'datasets' array

Looking at the script structure:
- Imports: json, numpy, pathlib, typing
- Functions: load_dataset, encode_language, create_example, main
- Main logic: loads data, creates examples, saves output

The preview_data_out.json shows the expected output format with datasets array containing examples.

Now I need to:
1. Create `mini_demo_data.json` - a curated subset
2. Create `code_demo.ipynb` following the notebook structure

For the notebook structure:
- Cell 1: Markdown title/description
- Cell 2: Install dependencies (aii-colab pattern)
- Cell 3: Imports
- Cell 4: Data loading helper with GitHub URL pattern
- Cell 5: Load data
- Config cell: Define tunable parameters (this script doesn't have many tunable parameters - maybe just which file to load)
- Processing cells: Split the original script logic into cells
- Results cell: Visualization

Let me check what files are available. The artifact info says the workspace_path is:
`/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qtJqn5LVU5LN/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1`
 
I need to locate the actual data files required for the demo. The script expects `data_out.json`, but I'm not seeing it in the expected location. I'll investigate the available files and determine how to proceed with creating the mini demo dataset.

The artifact information indicates several expected output files, including `full_data_out.json` and `mini_data_out.json`. I'll focus on finding or generating these files to ensure the demo can run correctly.

My next steps involve carefully searching the workspace directory, understanding the data generation process, and creating a minimal demo dataset that meets the project's

Now I understand the structure. The artifact has:
- `data.py` - the script that transforms the raw dataset to the expected schema
- `data_out.json` - the raw dataset (14MB, 1000 repos)
- `full_data_out.json` - the transformed dataset in exp_sel_data_out schema (641KB)
- `mini_data_out.json` - a mini version (2KB)
- `preview_data_out.json` - a preview version (1.9KB)

The data.py script:
1. Loads data_out.json
2. Transforms each repo into an example with features
3. Outputs full_data_out.json in the expected schema

For the demo notebook, I need to:
1. Create a mini_demo_data.json - I should use the existing mini_data_out.json or create an even smaller subset
2. Create a notebook that:
   - Has the install cell (following aii-colab)
   - Loads the data (using the GitHub URL pattern)
   - Runs the data.py logic
   - Visualizes the results

Looking at data.py, it's a simple script that:
- Has no external dependencies except numpy (which is for the type hints, not actually used in the code)
- Loads data_out.json
- Transforms it to the schema
- Saves full_data_out.json

The script is quite simple. For the notebook:
1. Install cell - need json (built-in), numpy (in the script but not really used), pathlib (built-in), typing (built-in)
2. Actually, looking more carefully, numpy is imported but only used in type hints. I can simplify.

Let me check what the actual data_out.json structure looks like to understand what the script processes

Now I understand the structure. The data.py script:
1. Loads data_out.json (raw repository data)
2. Transforms it into the exp_sel_data_out.json schema with examples
3. Each example has input (JSON string of features), output (survival status), and metadata

The script is relatively simple - it doesn't have many tunable parameters. The main thing is:
- The input file path (data_out.json)
- The output file path (full_data_out.json)

For the notebook:
1. I need to create mini_demo_data.json - a small subset of the data
2. Create a notebook that follows the structure in the instructions

Let me check what mini_data_out.json looks like to understand the expected output format better.

The script structure:
- Imports: json, numpy, pathlib, typing
- Functions: load_dataset, encode_language, create_example, main
- Main logic: load data, transform to examples, save output

For the notebook config cell, there aren't many tunable parameters. The script is a data transformation script, not a model training script. The main "parameters" would be:
- Input file path
- Output file path
- Maybe number of examples to process

But looking at the script, it processes ALL examples. For a demo, I should:
1. Create a small mini_demo_data.json with just a few examples (3-5)
2. Have the notebook load this data and run the transformation
3. Show the results

Let me check the mini_data_out.json to see what a small output looks like.

Now I understand the structure:

1. The data.py script takes `data_out.json` (raw GitHub OSS data) and transforms it into `full_data_out.json` (in the exp_sel_data_out schema format).

2. The input data (data_out.json) contains:
   - repo_id
   - metadata (stars, language, created_date, total_commits)
   - founder (founder, departure_date, is_departed)
   - survival (has_departure, pre/post departure commits, survival_status, months_observed_post)
   - knowledge_redundancy (top_contributors, pairwise_jaccard_scores, redundancy_score)
   - commits_sample (detailed commit data)

3. The output (full_data_out.json / mini_data_out.json) contains:
   - datasets array with dataset name and examples
   - Each example has:
     - input: JSON string with features (knowledge_redundancy_score, stars, language_encoded, total_commits, top_contributors_count, pre/post departure commits)
     - output: survival status (survived/died/no_departure)
     - metadata_* fields

4. The script is relatively simple - it's a data transformation script, not a training/evaluation script. So there aren't many "tunable parameters" in the traditional sense. The main thing is the input file path.

Now I need to:
1. Create a mini_demo_data.json - I should use the existing mini_data_out.json or create a small subset
2. Create the notebook following the structure in the instructions

Let me update my task list and proceed.

For the mini_demo_data.json, I should create a small curated subset. Looking at the artifact info, it says the dataset has 1000 repos with 768 having departures, 601 survivals, etc. The mini_demo should have just a few examples (3-10) that represent the different classes.

Since data.py transforms data_out.json to full_data_out.json, the demo should:


1. Load the raw data (data_out.json or a subset)
2. Run the transformation
3. Show the results

I'll create a mini version of data_out.json (the input) for the demo, then create the notebook that runs data.py logic on it. The key is making sure the notebook can load data from both GitHub and local sources, so I'll need to include the proper data loading pattern

The user wants me to convert the artifact's Python script (data.py) into a demo notebook. Let me understand what I need to do:

1. The artifact is a dataset type with a data.py script that transforms GitHub OSS data
2. I need to create:
   - mini_demo_data.json: a small subset of the input data for demo purposes
   - code_demo.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the data processing

From my analysis:
- data.py reads data_out.json (raw GitHub data with repos, contributors, etc.)
- It transforms this into full_data_out.json (experiment selection format)
- The script is relatively simple with no complex tunable parameters

For the demo:
1. I need to create mini_demo_data.json - a small subset of data_out.json (the input)
2. Create a notebook that:
   - Has proper install cells (following aii-colab)
   - Loads the mini demo data (from GitHub URL with local fallback)
   - Runs the transformation logic
   - Shows the results

Let me create the mini_demo_data.json first by extracting a few examples from data_out.json. The data_out.json file is about 14MB, so I need to be careful. I'll use Python to read just the first few entries.

Actually, looking at the data.py script more carefully:
- It loads data_out.json (the raw data)
- Processes it and creates full_data_out.json

For the demo, I should:
1. Create mini_demo_data.json containing a few repositories from data_out.json
2. Create a notebook that loads this data and runs the transformation

Let me create a small subset. I'll use Python to extract just the first 3-5 repos from data_out.json to create the mini demo data

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.

type: dataset
title: GitHub OSS founder departure survival dataset
summary: >-
  GitHub OSS survival dataset with 1000 repositories containing: (1) Knowledge redundancy scores computed via Jaccard similarity
  of file modification patterns among top contributors, (2) Founder departure events identified by 12+ months of inactivity,
  (3) Pre/post-departure activity metrics, (4) Repository metadata including stars, language, and creation date. The dataset
  enables analysis of whether knowledge redundancy predicts project survival after founder departure. Output classes: survived
  (601 repos), died (167 repos), no_departure (232 repos). All plan criteria met: 1000 repos, 768 with departures, 601 survivals,
  file size 0.61MB under 300MB limit, valid redundancy scores in [0,1] range, schema validation passed. Exhaustive search
  completed: 15+ HuggingFace queries, 13+ web searches, 4+ candidate datasets evaluated, real API collection attempted. No
  pre-collected dataset matches all requirements. Synthetic dataset is methodology-valid and suitable for research.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-a68c06-knowledge-redundancy-predicts-oss/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').

{"content": [{"cache_prompt": false, "type": "text", "text": "## Colab Runtime (as of 2026-02)\n\n- **Python**: 3.12.12\n- **OS**: Linux 6.6.105+ x86_64, glibc 2.35\n\n## Critical Rule: Do NOT pip install pre-installed packages ON COLAB\n\nColab's core scientific packages have **compiled C extensions** linked against each other at specific ABI versions. Installing ANY different version (even a minor bump) partially overwrites files while the loaded `.so` extensions stay in memory, causing:\n\n- `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed` (numpy 1.x vs 2.x ABI)\n- `ImportError: cannot import name '_center'` (numpy 2.0 vs 2.2 ABI)\n- Silent corruption of scipy/sklearn/pandas internals\n\n**On Colab: do NOT install these packages. Use Colab's versions.**\n**Locally: MUST install these packages at Colab's exact versions** to match the Colab environment.\n\n## Pre-installed Core Packages\n\nThese are pre-installed on Colab. On Colab: skip them. Locally: install at these exact versions.\n\n```\nnumpy==2.0.2\npandas==2.2.2\nscikit-learn==1.6.1\nscipy==1.16.3\nmatplotlib==3.10.0\nseaborn==0.13.2\ntorch==2.9.0+cpu\ntensorflow==2.19.0\nxgboost==3.1.3\nlightgbm==4.6.0\nnetworkx==3.6.1\nPillow==11.3.0\nopencv-python==4.13.0.92\nsympy==1.14.0\nstatsmodels==0.14.6\nbokeh==3.7.3\nplotly==5.24.1\nnltk==3.9.1\nspacy==3.8.11\ntransformers==5.0.0\ndatasets==4.0.0\ntokenizers==0.22.2\nhuggingface_hub==1.4.0\nopenai==2.17.0\nrequests==2.32.4\nbeautifulsoup4==4.13.5\nlxml==6.0.2\npydantic==2.12.3\ntqdm==4.67.3\nrich==13.9.4\ntabulate==0.9.0\nPyYAML==6.0.3\njsonschema==4.26.0\nh5py==3.15.1\nCython==3.0.12\nnumba==0.60.0\ndask==2025.12.0\npolars==1.31.0\npyarrow==18.1.0\n```\n\n## Install Cell Pattern\n\nThe install cell must work on BOTH Colab and local Jupyter. Use this conditional pattern:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# Packages NOT pre-installed on Colab (always install everywhere)\n_pip('some-rare-pkg==1.2.3')\n\n# Core packages (pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab env)\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')\n```\n\n**How this works:**\n- On **Colab**: `google.colab` is in `sys.modules` \u2192 skips core packages (uses Colab's pre-installed ones) \u2192 only installs non-Colab packages\n- **Locally**: `google.colab` is NOT in `sys.modules` \u2192 installs core packages at Colab's exact versions \u2192 local .venv matches Colab's environment as closely as possible\n\nRules:\n- CRITICAL: On Colab, pip installing ANY version of numpy/pandas/sklearn/scipy/matplotlib (even the same version) CORRUPTS the pre-loaded C extensions. These MUST be behind the `google.colab` guard.\n- Check the pre-installed package list above. If a package is on that list, put it in the `google.colab` guard block. If not, install it unconditionally.\n- For the local (non-Colab) install, use the EXACT versions from the list above so the local environment matches Colab.\n- Do NOT use `--force-reinstall` \u2014 corrupts Colab system packages.\n- Do NOT use `%pip` or `!pip` \u2014 use the `_pip()` helper for proper conditional control.\n- `%%capture` hides install noise \u2014 only add AFTER testing is done.\n- If a package requires a newer numpy/scipy than Colab has, that package is INCOMPATIBLE with Colab \u2014 find an older version or alternative.\n\n### Example\n\nCode imports: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `imodels`, `dit`, `rich`\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# imodels, dit \u2014 NOT on Colab, always install\n_pip('imodels==2.0.4')\n_pip('--no-deps', 'dit==1.5')\n\n# numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, rich \u2014 pre-installed on Colab, install locally only\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'matplotlib==3.10.0', 'rich==13.9.4')\n```\n\n### Checking if a package is pre-installed\n\nBefore adding a package to the install cell, check:\n1. Is it in the pre-installed list above?\n2. If unsure, skip it \u2014 Colab has 500+ packages pre-installed. If the import works without installing, it's pre-installed.\n\n## NumPy 2.0 Compatibility for Non-Colab Packages\n\nColab has **numpy 2.0.2**. NumPy 2.0 removed several long-deprecated APIs that older packages still use. If a non-Colab package was written for numpy 1.x, it may crash at runtime with errors like:\n\n- `AttributeError: np.alltrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n- `AttributeError: np.sometrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n- `AttributeError: np.product was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`\n\n**Fix**: Add a compat shim in the imports cell (BEFORE importing the affected package):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nif not hasattr(np, \"alltrue\"): np.alltrue = np.all\nif not hasattr(np, \"sometrue\"): np.sometrue = np.any\nif not hasattr(np, \"product\"): np.product = np.prod\n```\n\n**When to add this**: After installing non-Colab packages, test-run the notebook. If you get `AttributeError: np.X was removed`, add the corresponding shim. Common offenders: `dit`, older scientific libraries that haven't been updated for numpy 2.0.\n\n## Colab-Specific Gotchas\n\n1. **No kernel restart after pip install** \u2014 Unlike local Jupyter, Colab doesn't cleanly reload C extensions after pip install. Once numpy/scipy/sklearn are loaded, their C code stays in memory forever until full runtime reset.\n\n2. **`%pip` vs `_pip()` helper** \u2014 In notebook install cells, use the `_pip()` helper (see pattern above) so you can wrap installs in Python `if` conditionals. `%pip` and `!pip` can't be used inside if/else blocks.\n\n3. **File system** \u2014 `/content/` is the working directory. Files persist within a session but are lost on runtime disconnect.\n\n4. **Memory** \u2014 Free tier: ~12GB RAM. Pro: ~25-50GB. Monitor with `!free -h`.\n\n5. **Timeouts** \u2014 Free tier disconnects after ~90 min idle, ~12 hours max session. Pro: longer.\n\n6. **`%%capture`** \u2014 Suppresses all cell output including errors. Only use on install cells AFTER verifying they work. During development, leave install output visible.\n\n## Testing Notebooks Locally (Simulating Colab)\n\nThe goal: create a clean Python 3.12 .venv that mirrors Colab's environment, then run the notebook in it.\n\n```bash\npython3.12 -m venv .nb_env\n.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel\n.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb\nrm -rf .nb_env\n```\n\n**What happens when the notebook runs in this .venv:**\n1. The .venv starts empty (just jupyter + ipykernel)\n2. The install cell runs \u2192 `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules\n3. Non-Colab packages get installed unconditionally\n4. Core packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) get installed at Colab's exact versions via the `google.colab` guard\n5. Result: the .venv now has the same packages as Colab + the extra non-Colab packages = as close to Colab as possible\n\nThis ensures the notebook works from scratch with an environment matching Colab. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-colab`.

{"content": [{"cache_prompt": false, "type": "text", "text": "## Core Principles\n\n1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.\n2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.\n3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess \u2014 calculate.\n4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.\n5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.\n\n---\n\n## Gradual Scaling Sequence\n\nRun code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.\n\nSubstitute your actual file names:\n- `{mini_file}` \u2014 mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace\n- `{full_file}` \u2014 full dataset from dependency workspace\n- `{script}` \u2014 your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)\n- `{schema}` \u2014 JSON schema to validate output against\n\n**STEP 1 \u2014 MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.\n\n**STEP 2 \u2014 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.\n\n**STEP 3 \u2014 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.\n\n**STEP 4 \u2014 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.\n\n**STEP 5 \u2014 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.\n\n**STEP 6 \u2014 MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear \u2014 account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.\n\n## Final Testing Phase\n\nAfter completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:\n\nmini \u2192 10 \u2192 50 \u2192 100 \u2192 200 \u2192 max\n\nAt each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.\n\n---\n\n## Background Execution\n\nFor any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:\n\n1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`\n2. While it runs, use the time productively:\n   - Sanity-check previous outputs\n   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)\n   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale\n   - Prepare the next step\n3. Check back on the background task to get results\n4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run\n\n---\n\n## Resource Limits\n\nSet hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).\n\nPython example using stdlib `resource` module:\n```python\nimport resource\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM\nresource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time\n```\nExceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nAt each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.\n\n---\nThis skill is located at `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-long-running-tasks`.

```
Let me analyze what I've learned so far:

1. I've read the aii-colab skill - this gives me the install cell pattern for Colab compatibility
2. I've read the aii-long-running-tasks skill - this gives me guidance on scaling up gradually
3. I've seen the artifact directory structure - I can see the data.py file and various output files

Now I need to:
1. Read the data.py file (the main script)
2. Read the preview_data_out.json to understand the data structure
3. Create the mini_demo_data.json
4. Create the code_demo.ipynb notebook

Let me start by reading the data.py file and the preview data to understand the structure

Now I have a good understanding of the artifact. Let me summarize what I've learned:

1. **Artifact Type**: Dataset - GitHub OSS founder departure survival dataset
2. **Main Script**: `data.py` - transforms the raw GitHub OSS dataset into the `exp_sel_data_out.json` schema format
3. **Data Structure**:
   - Input: JSON file with repository data containing knowledge redundancy scores, founder departure info, survival status
   - Output: Examples with input (JSON string of features), output (survival status), and metadata
4. **Key Features**:
   - `knowledge_redundancy_score`: float in [0,1]
   - `stars`: int
   - `language_encoded`: int (encoded language)
   - `total_commits`: int
   - `top_contributors_count`: int
   - `pre_departure_commits_per_month`: float
   - `post_departure_commits_per_month`: float
   - Output classes: "survived", "died", "no_departure"

5. **Dependencies**: numpy (for the script, though it's only used for potential numerical operations)

Now I need to:
1. Create the task tracker with all TODOs
2. Read the full data to understand its structure better
3. Create `mini_demo_data.json` - a curated subset
4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` following the notebook structure

Let me start by setting up the task tracker and examining the data more closely. The script `data.py` actually transforms `data_out.json` to `full_data_out.json`. But looking at the artifact info, the expected output files are:
- data.py
- full_data_out.json
- preview_data_out.json
- mini_data_out.json

And the demo should use `mini_demo_data.json` which is a curated subset.
 
I need to clarify the data flow: the raw dataset appears to be `data_out.json` based on the script loading `Path('data_out.json')`, but the artifact mentions `full_data_out.json` as the complete dataset. Looking at the repo structure, I can see both `data_out.json` and `full_data_out.json` exist. The script transforms raw data into the experiment selection format, so I should work with `full_data_out.json` as the primary dataset and create a smaller subset for the

Now I understand the structure. Let me set up the task tracker and examine the data more closely to create the mini demo dataset.

The user wants me to convert a Python script into a demo notebook with minimal changes. Let me understand what I need to do:

1. The artifact is a dataset type with a Python script `data.py` that transforms GitHub OSS survival data
2. I need to create a Jupyter notebook that:
   - Has minimal changes to the original code
   - Splits into cells with markdown explanations
   - Uses the GitHub data loading pattern
   - Creates a `mini_demo_data.json` file
   - Outputs `code_demo.ipynb`

From what I've read:
- The `data.py` script is a simple transformation script that loads data from `data_out.json` and transforms it to `full_data_out.json` format
- The preview data shows the structure: datasets with examples containing input (JSON string of features), output (survival status), and metadata
- The script has no tunable parameters - it's just data transformation

Looking at the TODO list:
1. ✅ Read skills (done)
2. ✅ Read demo file and preview (done) - identified that this is a simple data transformation with no tunable parameters
3. Need to create `mini_demo_data.json`
4. Need to create `code_demo.ipynb`
5. Scale up if needed
6. Verify

For the mini_demo_data.json, I need to create a curated subset. Looking at the data structure, I should create a small JSON file that matches the expected format.

The expected format from preview_data_out.json is:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "github_oss_survival",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

But wait - looking at the artifact info more carefully, it says the data.py script is the "Dataset fetching/generation script". And the data loading pattern suggests loading `mini_demo_data.json` directly.


I need to examine the raw data more closely. The `data_out.json` appears to be the source format that `data.py` transforms, while `full_data_out.json` is the output. The preview shows the transformed structure with datasets and examples. I should check what `data_out.json` looks like to understand the complete data flow

The user wants me to create a demo notebook for the GitHub OSS founder departure survival dataset. Let me understand what I need to do:

1. I've read the aii-colab and aii-long-running-tasks skills
2. I've examined the data.py script and the data structure
3. The script is a simple data transformation script that:
   - Loads a dataset from data_out.json
   - Transforms each repo record into an example with input (JSON string of features), output (survival status), and metadata
   - Saves to full_data_out.json in exp_sel_data_out.json schema format

The data.py script doesn't have tunable parameters - it's just a data transformation script. The "config" would just be the input/output file paths.

Now I need to:
1. Create mini_demo_data.json - a curated subset of the data
2. Create code_demo.ipynb - a notebook that demonstrates the data transformation

For the mini_demo_data.json, I should create a small subset that shows the data structure. Looking at the artifact info, it says the dataset has 1000 repos with 768 having departures, 601 survivals, etc.

For the demo, I should:
1. Create a mini_demo_data.json with just a few examples (3-10) that show the variety of data
2. Create a notebook that:
   - Explains what the dataset is
   - Loads the mini data
   - Shows the transformation process
   - Visualizes some results

Let me update the task tracker and start creating the files
```

Now I understand the structure. The `data.py` script transforms raw GitHub OSS data into a formatted dataset. Let me update my progress and create the mini demo dataset.

Let me check the progress:

1. ✅ Read skills (aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks)
2. ✅ Read demo file and preview files - understood the structure
3. ✅ Creating mini_demo_data.json - just created with 10 examples
4. Next: Create code_demo.ipynb

Now I need to create the Jupyter notebook. The structure should be:
- Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description
- Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies (following aii-colab pattern)
- Cell 3 (code): Imports
- Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper with GitHub URL pattern
- Cell 5 (code): Load data
- Cell 6 (code): Config (though this script has minimal config)
- Cell 7+ (code): Processing - the actual data transformation
- Final cell: Visualization

The data.py script is a simple transformation script that:
1. Loads data from data_out.json
2. Transforms each repo into an example with features
3. Outputs in exp_sel_data_out.json schema format

Since this is a dataset artifact (not a model training script), there aren't many tunable parameters. The main "config" would be the input/output file paths.

Let me create the notebook now. I'll use the NotebookEdit tool or just create it directly with file_editor.

Actually, looking at the available tools, I don't see a "NotebookEdit" tool. I need to create the notebook as a JSON file manually or use file_editor to create it.

Let me create the notebook structure as a .ipynb file. Jupyter notebooks are JSON files with a specific structure.

The test environment setup is taking too long - it's installing packages which can be slow. Let me check if the process is still running or if it timed out. I should kill the process and try a different approach - maybe test the notebook manually or just verify the structure is correct.

Let me think about what to do next. The test environment approach with creating a full venv and running nbconvert timed out. This is taking too long.

Let me try a different approach:
1. Verify the notebook structure manually by checking the JSON
2. Test the Python code directly in a simpler way
3. Make sure the key requirements are met

The key things I need to verify:
1. code_demo.ipynb contains the correct GITHUB_DATA_URL
2. mini_demo_data.json exists
3. The notebook uses the GitHub URL pattern with local fallback

Let me check these directly and also test the core Python code more simply

The test is failing because the GitHub URL is actually loading (it's returning some data), but it's returning the wrong format. Let me check what's happening.

Wait - the GitHub URL doesn't exist yet (the files will be pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation). So the load_data() function should fall back to local file. But it says "Loaded 1 repos" which means it loaded something.

Oh I see - the GitHub URL might be returning a 404 or some error page, and the `json.loads()` is parsing something unexpected. Let me check what's happening.

Actually, looking more carefully - the error says "Loaded 1 repos" which means the GitHub URL load succeeded but returned unexpected data. This is strange. Let me debug this.

Wait - I think I misunderstood. The GitHub URL load "failed" but the exception was caught, so it should fall back to local. But it says "Loaded 1 repos" - so something loaded. Let me check if maybe there's already a mini_demo_data.json in the current directory.

Actually, I realize the issue - I'm in the workspace directory and there IS a mini_demo_data.json file I created earlier. So the local fallback is working, but it seems to have loaded only 1 repo? Let me check the file.

Oh wait - I see the issue. The test script said "Loaded 1 repos" - but I created 10 examples. Let me check what's in the mini_demo_data.json file.

Actually, I think the issue is that the GitHub URL is actually loading something (maybe a redirect or error page) and that's being parsed as JSON. Let me fix the load_data function to be more careful about what it loads.

Actually, looking at the code again - the `urllib.request.urlopen` might be following redirects and getting an error page that happens to be valid JSON. Let me add better error handling.

But first, let me just check what's in the mini_demo_data.json file

The mini_demo_data.json file is correct. The issue is that the `load_data()` function is actually loading from the GitHub URL and getting a different format, or there's some other issue. Let me check what's happening.

Wait, looking at the error output again:
```
Loaded 1 repos
```

It says "Loaded 1 repos" but the file has 10 repos. This means the GitHub URL is being accessed and returning something different, or the local file isn't being loaded properly.

Actually, I think I see the issue. The test script is trying to access the GitHub URL which doesn't exist yet (the files haven't been pushed to GitHub yet). So it falls back to the local file. But the error says "Loaded 1 repos" which is strange...

Wait, let me re-read the error. It says "Loaded 1 repos" - but I just verified the file has 10 repos. Let me check if there's an issue with the load_data function in the test.

Oh I see - the test script I ran had an issue. The local file should have 10 repos. Let me re-run the test more carefully.

Actually, I think the issue might be that my test script had an error. Let me re-run the test properly to see what's happening. The key thing is:
1. mini_demo_data.json has 10 repos (verified)
2. The load_data function should load from local file
3. The transformation should work

Let me test again more carefully.

The test is failing because `data` only has 1 item but the error says `KeyError: 0` when trying to access `data[0]`. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the output.

Oh I see - it says "Loaded 1 repositories" but then the error is KeyError: 0 when checking `data[0]`. This is strange. Let me look more carefully...

Actually wait - the output says "Loaded 1 repositories" but then there's a KeyError: 0. This suggests that `data` is a dict with key 0 not being present... but that doesn't make sense if `len(data)` is 1.

Oh! I think I see the issue. The GitHub URL might be returning something unexpected. Let me check what `load_data()` actually returns.

Actually, I think the issue is that when the GitHub URL fails (which it will since the file isn't pushed yet), it falls back to local file. But the local file load might be returning something unexpected.

Let me check what's happening more carefully. Actually I think I need to print out the actual type and content of `data` to debug this.

Let me create a simpler test that just checks the local file loading
